Software Revision: V3.11.00_2

Attack type: Stored XSS

Summary: Web application fails to sanitize user input on Network TCP/IP configuration page. This allows the attacker to inject shell code in the device which will be executed once the data is received after few seconds. This allows the attacker to create a backdoor in the device or just execute a reverse shell which connects to the attacker machine. Successful exploitation requires admin access to the management of the device with a valid or hijacked session.
